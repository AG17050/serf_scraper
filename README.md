# serf_scraper


If you wish to use windows scheduler to run the scraper, ensure you've put your username and the appropriate virtual environment in the
`serf_filing.bat` file, as well as the appropriate path to the file (assuming you cloned the repo on your desktop).

You also need to make sure you have the necessary chromedriver in the main folder (typically the lastest stable release).
