If you wish to use windows scheduler to run the scraper, ensure you've put your username and the appropriate virtual environment in the
`serf_filing.bat` file, as well as the appropriate path to the file (assuming you cloned the repo on your desktop).

`"C:/Users/<username>/AppData/Local/conda/conda/envs/<virtualenv>/python.exe" "C:/Users/<username>/OneDrive - Anthem/Desktop/serf_scraper/main.py"`
